# Agritech Insights System

## Description
The **Agritech Insights System** is an AI-powered platform designed to provide farmers and agricultural professionals with actionable insights based on their farm data. It helps farmers optimize their farming practices, increase yields, and access government schemes, all while evaluating the genuineness of distributor prices through comparative market analysis. The system uses data analytics and machine learning models to offer personalized recommendations for crop selection, based on the farm’s soil conditions, climate, and other factors.

Additionally, farmers can provide details about their land and apply for various government schemes directly through the platform. The government can then analyze the submitted data to provide better-targeted schemes and improve decision-making.

## Key Features
- **Input Data Collection**: Users can input relevant farm data such as soil parameters, climate conditions, and geographic location, including specific details about their land.
- **Market Price Evaluation**: The system compares distributor prices with retail market prices to help farmers evaluate the genuineness of distributors.
- **Government Scheme Assistance**: Farmers can apply for various government schemes directly through the system by submitting their farm details.
- **Government Data Analysis**: The government can analyze the data submitted by farmers to determine eligibility for various schemes and make data-driven decisions.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The system preprocesses the input data to handle missing values, normalize or scale features, and transform categorical variables.
- **Machine Learning Models**: The system employs various machine learning algorithms (such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and more) for crop recommendations and market analysis.
- **Crop Recommendation**: Based on the trained models, the system suggests the best crops suited for a specific farm’s conditions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The system provides an intuitive interface for users to easily input data, view recommendations, apply for government schemes, and explore additional resources.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for developing the application, data analysis, and machine learning.
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the backend and managing HTTP requests.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation library for preprocessing and analyzing input data.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical operations, used in handling arrays and calculations.
- **HTML/CSS**: Technologies used to build and style the web interface.
- **JavaScript**: Scripting language for client-side functionality and user interaction.
